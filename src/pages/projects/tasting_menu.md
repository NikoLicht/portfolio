shortText: We worked with some (self chosen) design constraints; simple analog controls and timed levels. This means you can pick up how to play a minigame with relative ease and you finish it within minute or two. Worth highlighting is that we created approximately 20 minigames, but chose to only included the 10 best.

In tasting menu I acted as lead designer. I tried to manage / cheer on a small team of five persons with different competences and experience. I messed a bit up, but learned a lot along the way.
