summary: I made a fun little project where I made some assets for some friends making a game. 
shortText: A little fun project where my focus was to make very tangible items that all could be plugged into an outlet. it was important for me to make a system where there could only be a single cable coming in to each outlet. Further, the animation should be parametric. And so the cables are animated making a curve based on the normals of the item and the plug.

    text: "I had a lot of focus on making the animation procedural. That being said, the objects does require some setup, as they need to know where the cable should connect from. I was going for a somewhat retro art style, but wanted to play around with some gradient shading, rather than the flat shaded style i usually go for"
