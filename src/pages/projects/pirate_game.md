On this project, which is also my current job, I work as a techincal artist. I started out doing primarily 3D assets for the game. But quickly touched on more technical areas. Including scripting in Blender for workflow improvements or more precise modeling and extending editor functionality in Unity for easier (and less error prone) setup of game assets. Finally I have moved onto writing production code (components and core-loop stuff) that is a core part of the game.
