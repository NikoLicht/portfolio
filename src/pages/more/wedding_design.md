summary: A little set of save-the-date and invitation for a wedding.
shortText: I designed this set of wedding information. It was designed for printing. I used the clients own water color paintings to create a more personal touch. They also wanted a 2-fold z style pamplet for the invitation. That was a bit tricky to work with. I ended up visualizing it in BLender before printing.

    text: To be completely sure of where what went in the design, I created a blender model that was uv-mapped to the invitation. This was a good way to communicate with the client exactly how it would look, without spending a lot of money on printer ink! It very closely resembles the final result as you can see.
