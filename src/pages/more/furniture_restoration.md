    text: So much work went into this project. But it has been super fun, and I've learned so much about restoration tools and ... patience. I still wonder if I put the right parts together, especially chair five.

    text: What a surprise; this was also a lot of work. But mostly due to big areas, and long wait times. This was mostly due to also finishing four extension tops. It does not fit in our apartment with all extensions in.
