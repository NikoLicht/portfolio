summary: A cute little game, where you have to place the house in the *just right* placement
shortText: I came up with this idea, as I love skiing games and am currently looking for a house with the perfect placement myself. Mostly i worked on the looks and the feel of the game. Not so much the systems.

    text: This is just a cute little game. It could use a little more polish. I kinda like the jerky arkade-like controls. For this project I also really wanted to create a dialog system, where the avatar you control can talk back to you, and give off some (kinda sad) personality. I think it comes off quite cute.
