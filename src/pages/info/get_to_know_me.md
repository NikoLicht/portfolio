overview:
  - title: "Getting good at stuff."
    text: "I have a lot of hobbies. I often take on new hobbies and new areas of responsibility, because i enjoy getting good at new stuff. Especially stuff where i am creating somthing. I sometimes try to learn Spanish, sometimes I knit stuff, sometimes I try to make music and sometimes I try to ferment stuff. There is almost nothing that don't interest me. I say try, because I plan on succeding, but know failure is part of the journey."

  - title: "Working with me üòà."
    text: "I like knowing where we are going, and won't hesitate to ask questions. I am fine with sailing in unfamiliar waters, as long as we can make a plan of action. I thrive when we keep momentum, rather than stopping and inspecting every detail. I like teamworking with competent people, who can teach me new stuff. I also like joking around, having fun and enjoy an occational beer with colleagues. Ill also tell you bad jokes."

  - title: "Things I like to do at work."
    text: "I know this is not a common role, but I like taking an asset the whole way. I like making the model, rigging it, setting it up in whatever game engine and programming the behaviour / system needed. I like the intersection between graphics and programming and like to dig into both. The programmer in me can appreciate a neat system that does what it should do, is modular, and easy to use. üë®‚Äçüç≥ chefs kiss. Oh yeah, I DIG optimized solutions. Stuff in shaders is neat, and pooling systems, oh boy."
