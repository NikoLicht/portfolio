So I recently started fishing a little with my friends, because we are yearning for the ocean - or we are all just in our thirties. This is a log of that. We don't know a great deal about fishing, and only have used or cheap gear.

 When I was a kid, with my dad. | Musholm bugt  | Kids rod and waders  | Nothing   | Lost many lures

 ### Goals
1. ~~Just getting out there and trying.~~
1. Would be kinda cool to catch something.
3. I'd love to try fly fishing. 
   - But my understanding is that it can be hard to be social while casting, as you need a bigger distance between fishers. It also seems very technical, but that is what reels me in. heh.
4. Fishing from a boat
5. Grilling a fish.
