Lately I've been thinking about foundational and basic knowledge. More specifically about the importance and role of that kind of knowledge as opposed to the more specific and trendy knowledge. 
I promise I am not gonna get all epistemological on you, as I _really_ am no expert in that subject. However, I will have a hard time denying that what I am about to write about, and what you are about to read about, _is_ strongly related to epistemology.

I tend to fall for books that claim to provide foundational knowledge in some subject. I think it is the inner Nikolaj telling me that I need to master the basics before I can dive into more specific subjects.
