shortText: How to cope with never living up to your own ideal of yourself.
---
Everyday, every hour, there is a new post somewhere out there about a new thing you should do, or a new way you should do something you already do. Could be yoga, maybe a new way to cut pineapple or writing a journal. I certainly cannot keep up with all of that. If there was some alternative version of me, who did yoga, cut pineapple in new ways and wrote about it all in a journal, then I cannot even imagine what he must have given up to become that.

Just kidding. But also not really. 

## The Ideal
I think we all bonk ourselves in the head, because we are not living up to our own idea of the perfect self. It is many years ago, but i read a book, called Our Superheroes, Ourselves [^1]. I was probably like 15 back then, and was very much into superheroes. My takeaway from that book was that I should try to be as my favorite super hero, as superheroes are simply ideals of human nature.

## My ideal self

1. Is physically active, and wants to be physically active
2. Reads books
3. Speaks multiple languages
4. Plays instruments
5. Makes good investments
6. Cooks good food
7. Sees friends and family
8. Does things he is good at, like hobbies.
10. Meditates
11. Does crafts
12. Keeps a journal
13. Builds stuff
14. Is happy
15. Has time for relaxing
16. Is healthy in all ways

## Will the ideal make you happy?
After having read _The happiness project_[^2], I've adopted the mantra, that life is about being happy. We should each attempt to build a life that makes us happy. As G. Rubin[^2] touches on, a lot of different factors goes into being happy. Some are smaller things, some are bigger things. Some are hard to change, some are surprisingly moldable. As I am writing this, I realize that we have this idea, that we will be happy, if we live up to our own ideal selves. But as soon as we move a step closer to that ideal, the ideal moves a bit further away. So the whole mentality, that you will only be 'good enough' or be happy, when you have achieved that is flawed. Then you will never be happy.
On the other hand, I am not making the case for complacency to the extend that you never try to improve.
I think the trick is to redefine ideal. Your (and my) ideal, is not fixed. The ideal is (drumroll please) ... the journey. The ideal me is a me who is on a journey to become something more. <mark>I am already ideal, but moving towards something is just what makes life interesting</mark>.

## The impossible
I quickly discovered, that it is really hard to do it all. Really hard to live up to our own ideals. Especially because our ideals change the better we get. On top of that, the idea we have of our ideal selves, are often also people who have waaaaaaay more than 24 hours a day. I tried to plan out a 'perfect day' involving all the things i should do, as well as the things I wanted to do. But that quickly exceeds 24 hours. And i can really only do something for 60 seconds an hour, or I get super sleepy.
