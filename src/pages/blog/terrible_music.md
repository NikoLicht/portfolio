I try to never let perfection hold me back. It can be really daunting to try something new, if you set out with the goal of creating something perfect. Additionally, it can be very hard to know ahead of the process what perfection looks like, especially when operating in the creative or creative-adjacent space. In creative projects, there is often not really consequences if you mess up, and end up with a subpar result. But there is a lot to be learned by finishing an inperfect project. 
For instance, when creating music, I often times impose the constraint on myself that I only have 1-2 hours from start to finish. This ususally results in terrible music, but at the same time a productive and fun 1-2 hours. And in those 1-2 hours I also tend to learn quite a lot, as there is no room for getting stuck.
