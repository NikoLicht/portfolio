The older I've gotten, the more I value things that will last and maybe even outlast me. This often impacts the material and constuction I am looking for. Often, i find myself looking for metals, as that is the 'golden' (haha) standard for durability. Construction wise, simple is almost always better. Though, the more seperate components, the easier it is to replace only a single part. Further, it can be valuable to look at the connections and joints, as that is where the most stress occurs (apart from any parts that actually does work, like a blade). 

Yet most often, this is almost a feeling we have when we pick up something. Alone the heft and sounds it makes when moved, can be a very accurate indicator of all these things.

When I pick up a tool (broad definition) _it is whispering to me, reassuring me, that it can be a partner in rituals and routines_. The fact that it is sturdy and will last, is confirming how it will cement its role in my life, and how I can count on it for years on end.

Here is a list of the metal things that support my rituals.
- Double edged safety razor.
- Moka pot.
- Vintage Camera.
- Wine- and bottle opener.
- Cast iron pans.
- Stanley fatmax knife.
- Manual coffee grinder.
- Weights for lifting.
- Hurricane lanterns.
- Fountain pens.

All of these metal objects support me in small rituals and routines in my everyday life. Some are only used a few times a year, some are used multiple times per week.

## Rituals
And I know that I might just be a little hipster inside, but I feel that there has been a resugence in these objects because you can depend on them and their function. Sure, it is being marketed as 'manly', but I think more their (rising?) popularity is due to the more and more frequent changes in our lives and livelyhoods. I can lose my job, but my metal thing will be there. New laws and regulations can change our lives, but my cast iron pans will be there to witness the changes with me.
They can support me in creating a routine in a world that changes so rapidly.

I think we all crave small rituals. For many people coffee brewing is more than just consumption. It is something more. Something where value is derived from not only the end-product but also the process. And I really think this extends to many other objects.

## Materials
As an exercise, I made this little table for examining the materials i surround myself with. The idea is not to say that wood is best (but it is). But rather to just think about qualities I (generally) value in materials in relation to . 

| **Material** | **Durable** | **Repairable** | **Recyclable** | **Eco-friendly** |
|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|
| **Wood**     | x           | x              | -              | x                |
| **Metal**    | x           | (x)            | x              | -                |
| **Glass**    | -           | -              | x              | -                |
| **Plastic**  | -           | x              | x              | -                |
| **Leather**  | x           | x              | -              | -                |
| **Stone**    | x           | -              | -              | x                |
| **Ceramic**  | x           | -              | -              | x                |

Not all materials are in this list. But more importantly, not all columns are in this table. Some aspects are more important in certain scenarios, like if you have an infant, maybe _'chance of shattering into a dangerous mess'_ is higher on the list. Or if you are a poor college student, you factor _'price'_ above all else. But I am me. And I think that these factors best align with myself and with the rituals I perform. Such as coffee making, beard shaving, photo taking and so on.
