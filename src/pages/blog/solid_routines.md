The older I've gotten, the more i value sturdy, quality, metal, hardwood, made-to-last, vintage, simple things. The more simple they are the better. When I pick up a tool (in the broad definition), and can feel its heft, it is whispering to me, reassuring me, that it can be a partner in rituals and routines. The fact that it is sturdy and will last, is confirming how it will cement its role in my life, and how I can count on it.

Here is a list of the metal things that support my rituals.
- Double edged safety razor.
- Moka pot.
- Vintage Camera.
- Wine- and bottle opener.
- Cast iron pans (despite them actually being somewhat brittle).
- Stanley fatmax knife.
- Manual coffee grinder.
- Weights for lifting.
- Hurricane lanterns.
- Fountain pens.
- Tattoos?

  
And I know that I might just be a little hipster inside, but I feel that there has been a resugence in these objects because you can depend on them and their function. Sure, it is being marketed as 'manly', but I think more their (rising?) popularity is due to the more and more frequent changes in our lives and livelyhoods. I can lose my job, but my metal thing will be there. New laws and regulations can change our lives, but my cast iron pans will be there to witness the changes with me.
