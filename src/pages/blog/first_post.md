Welcome to the first blog post. For my 'bingo' card for 2025, I created a field, that said 'create a blog'. I've considered multiple approaches, even executed on a few of them. But after a talk with my buddy [frans](https://frans.today), I realized that the fastest way to achieve that bingo field was to simply extend my portfolio website.
There is not a server or a backend running things, there is simply static side generation. That also means that I am forced to build everytime I need to add anything.

#### What will it be about?
Well, it will probably be semi-incoherent ramblings about things I have been thinking about, things I enjoy or things that I would like to explore while writing a little about them.

#### Is it for you?
Maybe not. It is mostly for me. I think the exercise of clarifying thoughs to such an extend that other people can read them, is great, as it forces one to really think about what is important to get across. But honestly that will be too much to live up to, and knowing myself, I strive more towards execution rather than perfection.
