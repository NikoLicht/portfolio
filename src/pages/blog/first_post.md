Welcome to the first blog post. For my 'bingo' card for 2025, I created a field, that said 'create a blog'. I've considered multiple approaches, even executed on a few of them. But after a talk with my buddy [frans](https://frans.today), I realized that the fastest way to check off that bingo field was to simply extend my portfolio website.
There is "not a server or a backend running things"-ish, there is simply static side generation. That also means that I am forced to build every time I need to add anything.

### About the bingo thingo
It it really just meant as a fun exercise where we discuss and explore what we would like to happen, hope to happen, or could see potentially happening. Some of these are easy to achieve while others are super hard. It is also not a competition between my wife and me. I think my wife got the idea from the internet[^1]. Either way, it has been pretty fun, and <mark>has served a bit as a guideline for doing things</mark>.
Here you can see my bingo board for 2025. This is an unmarked version and a few of the fields have been marked off.

### What will the blog be about?
Well, <mark>it will probably be semi-incoherent ramblings</mark> about things I have been thinking about, things I enjoy or things that I would like to explore while writing a little about them.

### Is it for you?
No. Maybe. <mark>It is mostly for me</mark>. I think the exercise of clarifying thoughts to an extend that other people can read and maybe understand them. The hope is that it forces me to really think about the core of what I am saying. But honestly that will be too much to live up to, and knowing myself, I strive more towards execution rather than perfection.
