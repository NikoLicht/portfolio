### Fly fishing videos
I can really recommend fly fishing videos in general. Often you will find older men standing in a river talking about nature and technicalities of fly fishing. It is super relaxing to watch. If you go down this rabbit-hole you will discover countless videos of people making their flies - which is almost a hobby in its own right.

### Sailing
Moving into a slightly different area, but staying in the water. Old sailing videos are nice. The water, the technique, the vhs grain. Amazing.

### Photography
Featuring another of my hobbies here, analog photography. You will find many instructional videos about how to shoot a camera, how to use a light-meter, how to use the different rules, but they can at times become very clinical which is far removed from the reality of shooting on film. <mark>I like the somewhat new channel [Kodak Took My Money](https://www.youtube.com/@KodakTookMyMoney) for the relaxed and more 'real life' vibe of analog photography</mark>. Highly recommend the content and the humor.

### Motorcycles
I've also discovered the vast amount of videos about people traveling on motorcycles across states, countries and continents. It is really interesting to see how their adventure unfolds meanwhile being exposed to the cultures they surround themselves with. I particularly find the channel [Una Moto](https://www.youtube.com/@Una_Moto) worthwhile - but watch the content in order to get the most out of it.
