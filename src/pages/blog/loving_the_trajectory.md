I have been thinking about love. Not in a way that should worry you. I *still* love you, my fiends and my family. But I have been thinking about love conceptually and in the light of *the only constant is change*. 

### Everyone changes.
There are no constant persons, people or personalities. We always change. You are probably changing right now and I do not blame you. <mark>You were quite boring those few seconds ago</mark>. We are not a still image of our own personality or our own lives. So many things change and evolve around us and within us that it is bound to have huge impact on us.

### Perception.
I also don't think that we can ever get a precise understanding of a person. We can have a good idea, but we will never know exactly. I imagine that everyone is surrounded by this big vague blob that encapsulate their likely current persona and life. You might not know if I am angry right now, but you know how I am if i am angry. You know the size and shape of my big vague blob. Very similar to how we don't know where electrons are, but only their likely location.

### Trajectory
Finally the part about the trajectory. We can like or love things with confidence. They often stay somewhat constant. <mark>My couch has not picked up any hobbies or bad habits since I bought it</mark>. But people, you know know now, do change. To me saying that *I love someone* is taking into account both their blob and the fact that they will change. This probably makes me a bit of a romantic. Now let us talk math. 

![Poorly made illustration of the coordinate system I am about to explain.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dlb3lkuge/image/upload/v1760991992/trajectory_zos1hs.png)

Imagine a coordinate system. The person you love is at origin, *(0, 0)*. But really it is their whole current blob so it might take up a bit of undefinable space around origin. On the x-axis we have time and on the y-axis we have the life they will lead. You know some of their dreams, past, wants, needs, dislikes, and so on. From this you can kinda trace out a *likely trajectory* that their whole blob will move along throughout their lives. <mark>(43, 23) will be particularly good</mark>. Their might even be some attractors or repellers along the way, that will affect their trajectory. Just like the gravity of planets have effect on the trajectory of a rocket. I still am not sure exactly which flavour of interpolation will yield the best fit, but see it as an exercise for the reader to figure out. 

When I love someone, I love their current person, their blob and what I think is their likely trajectory (or likely trajectories).

### Hate.
I had to go there. I think that I believe in the best in people. But there are sometimes where we meet people out in the real world, and they do a tiny thing wrong. But the tiny thing speaks volumes about them, their blob and their trajectory. Sometimes they will have time to get back on a track where you can still like them. But other times the small act will have a huge impact on their trajectory (in your eyes) and you will never allow yourself to really like them. One might even say hate, but that probably requires a bit more than a 'little act'. Okay I might sound a little judgemental. Those of you who know me, know that I am a very roomy person.
