I recently hosted a little casual wine tasting for friends. The theme was 'Friendly Chaos'. Conceptually that meant that everyone was to bring one bottle of wine, no rules. It could be wine they liked drinking, wine they hated, or wine they just wanted to taste. For me it was mostly about trying to <mark>host a wine tasting, without making it super formal</mark>.
As guests (good friends) arrived, we would lump similar wine together and put appropriate wine in the fridge. Then as we progressed we would do comparative tasting between two wines at a time. This was very fun.

As a means to keep track of the wines, I've created this wine tasting sheet / form, that each participant would fill out. <mark>Complete with fun facts, checkboxes, and other niceties</mark>.

Feel free to <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ahap54BhP6OmaXjw9ALFBY88Ug4JU5bk"  class="download-btn" download >download</a> the pdf, print and use it with your own friends and foes.

### Improvements for next time
Next time I will definitely <mark>enforce more strict rules for the wine</mark>, to ensure they are more easily comparable, hopefully leading to the participants ( myself included ) learning more. For instance, only red, only italian, only natural, only negro-amaro or something else, would lead to a better less chaotic understanding. Maybe even just a 'classical' grapes tasting would be cool. Yet hard to arrange.
