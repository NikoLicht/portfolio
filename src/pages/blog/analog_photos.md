shortText: How analog photography impacts my wallet and life.
---

I originally got into analog photography because I fell for mechanical feeling when trying out my friends Pentax K1000. The shutter and the winding mechanisms were particularly exciting. Soon after I got my hands on a Pentax K2 and some expired film that my parents had forgotten in a drawer.
Since then (around 2022), I've been though quite a few rolls of film. I've even added a few cameras to my collection. As of writing, I have expanded my collection to also include a few different cameras.

*My Pentax K2*

| **Camera**      | **Film** | **State**      | **Comment**    | **Bought for** |
|:---------------:|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| **Pentax K2**   | 35mm     | Mostly working | Primary Camera | 900 Dkk        |
| **Nikon Fm**    | 35mm     | Working        | Backup Camera  | 615 Dkk        |
| **Ikoflex IIa** | 120      | Working        | So much fun    | 500 Dkk        |
| **Yashica-Mat** | 120      | Not working    | Sad            | 450 Dkk        |

But in reality the real cost of analog photography is the film, the development and the scanning. I can only recommend the store ![Shutterbug](https://shutterbugcph.dk/) if you need to develop in copenhagen. They are friendly and helpful.

### Cost Breakdown 35

| Math                         |          |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Film per roll                            | 270 / 3 = 90  |
| Total cost per roll                      | 90 + 50 + 75 = 215 kr. |
| Cost per photo                           | 215 / 35 ≈ 6.14 kr. |

**≈ 215 kr. per roll**  
**≈ 6.14 kr. per photo**

### Cost Breakdown 120

| Math                         |          |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Total cost per roll                      | 120 + 60 + 75 = 255 kr. |
| Cost per photo                           | 255 / 12 ≈ 21.25 kr. |

**≈ 255 kr. per roll**  
**≈ 21.25 kr. per photo**


## My point being
To me at least, the fact that it is expensive to make a photo, reminds me that I should make sure to experience moments in life that are worth that price. Worthy of a photo. Though, I don't think every moment must be photographed - it's also important to live in the moment. 
I am very much a photographer for myself. I serve myself. I take photos for my own future reminiscing of good times with friends and family. My photos are rarely masterpieces, but imperfectly captures a real moment. If they are super shitty, it is because I had a great time. If you are curious check some of them out [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNmj_b66m4hsL4wxDlr063fvHkjUyZWybj5Xevx31tC7Y-cydDFLzlJwi9_V-VZjw?key=NFk3TERqUVlyY3hIa0FNaHlTcEJycjhYM2MzQVln).

But even though you might take photos of nature, architecture or more abstract subjects, I think that the idea still stands. You should live the moments that your film is worth. Your time is worth _slightly_ more than celluloid film anyway.
