shortText: How analog photography impacts my wallet and life.
---

I originally got into analog photography because I fell for mechanical feeling when trying out my friends Pentax K1000. The shutter and the winding mechanisms were particularly exciting. Soon after I got my hands on a Pentax K2 and some expired film that my parents had forgotten in a drawer.
Since then (around 2022), I've been though quite a few rolls of film. I've even added a few cameras to my collection. As of writing, I have expanded my collection to also include a few different cameras.

| **Camera**      | **Film** | **State**      | **Comment**    | **Bought for** |
|:----------------|:--------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| **Pentax K2**   | 135     | Mostly working | Primary Camera | 900 Dkk        |
| **Nikon Fm**    | 135     | Working        | Backup Camera  | 615 Dkk        |
| **Ikoflex IIa** | 120      | Working        | So much fun    | 500 Dkk        |
| **Yashica-Mat** | 120      | Not working    | Sad            | 450 Dkk        |

But in reality the real cost of analog photography is the film, the development and the scanning. I can only recommend the store [Shutterbug](https://shutterbugcph.dk/), if you need to develop in copenhagen. They are friendly and helpful.

## My point being
To me at least, the fact that it is expensive to make a photo, reminds me that <mark>I should make sure to experience moments in life that are worth spending that price to capture forever</mark>. Worthy of a photo. Though, I don't think every moment must be photographed - it's also important to simply live in the moment. 
I am very much a photographer for myself. I serve myself. I take photos for my own future reminiscing of good times with friends and family. My photos are rarely masterpieces, but imperfectly captures a real moments. If they are super shitty, it is because I had a great time. If you are curious check some of them out [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNmj_b66m4hsL4wxDlr063fvHkjUyZWybj5Xevx31tC7Y-cydDFLzlJwi9_V-VZjw?key=NFk3TERqUVlyY3hIa0FNaHlTcEJycjhYM2MzQVln).


You might take photos of nature, architecture or more abstract subjects, I think that the idea still stands. You should live the moments that your film is worth. <mark>Your time is worth _slightly_ more than celluloid film anyway</mark>.

## The moments.
I nominate the below moments as my best celluloid entrapped moments so far. The nomination is loosely based on which photos I get the happiest from looking at.
- Proposal to my wife (used the build in pseudo-reliable timer).
- Birthday hangout in the sun with a campfire.
- Hangout with friends at big table or activities with friends.
- More family stuff.
- Really any photo of my _stunning_ wife.
- The photos my wife take of me. She is often a better photographer than i am.

Based on this not-very-scientific list, it is clear that I should out more with friends and family, or propose to my wife again, even if I need to take a few pictures.
