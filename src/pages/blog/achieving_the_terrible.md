shortText: My process on creating terrible things
---

I am a creative person. I have an inner need to create, build and play. I have a tonne of projects, some more involved than others. _But how do you do it Nikolaj_ - you might ask. The answer is that:

1. I am very curious about new things, almost to a fault. 
2. I never expect perfect execution.
3. Treat everyone else as experts


### Being curious
Being curious can be hard for force about certain topics. Im not interested in literally everything. I do have my limits. But I do try to approach almost everything with a curious mindset. I read in this book _Chop wood, Carry water_[^1], that every challenge is an opportunity to learn. I often think about that. Especially when things aren't going the way I imagined. Be curious about new stuff.

### On never expecting perfection
This one is like 90% of the work. When I set out to do something, eg. create music, the goal is to create something, not to create something perfect. Particularly with music, I often enforce a time limit of 1-2 hours and then I tell myself that I have to publish by then. And sure enough, there is *a lot* of terrible music on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/rustfri). It is very rough, and not super catchy, *but* it is out there, and I made it. If you give it a listen, please know that I am not delusional. I know that it is pretty bad. I am just not ashamed about it.
It is very important for me that my projects don't just lie dormant, on my windowsill or in my desktop folder. I really think that enforcing some kind of constraints can be a great way to ensure finishing.
 
You can always get better at getting good results. Speaking of getting better at getting good results. I often think about a paragraph in _The lean startup_[^2], where Eric explains how it can be beneficial to try the whole process out, before targeting efficiency. I recall that it is regarding the somewhat famous story about how Toyota became a success.
I stumbled into this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/msxazr/the_real_meaning_of_dont_let_the_perfect_be_the/)[^3], which also has some truly great links and quotes. Check it out, if you are _curious_.

Even this blog is kinda half-assed. I don't spend hours on hours on writing. I just jam it in there, read it 0.5 times and publish. Sorry, but not sorry. Hope you like unfiltered brain juice.


### Treating people as experts
You never really know how much someone else knows at something. So treat them as the expert, and you might learn something new. On top of that - achieving expert level of usage is never a linear path, especially within creative matters. Meaning that even people new to a field, can make discoveries or have perspectives that even an expert might learn something from.
