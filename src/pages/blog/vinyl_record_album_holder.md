Not a lot of reflection here. Just a little story about building a shelf for holding vinyl records. In essence it is a piece of wood with a groove in it. It 'should be relatively simple' and 'I have all the tools already' are some of the clever things I've said before starting.

### Design

*The different designs in consideration*

Originally I considered two different designs, design A and B. But after talking with a carpenter at a family event, I was put onto the path of design C. 

**Design A** is made by a single piece of wood, and will be mounted using keyhole hangers. It is relatively simple. But it will be hard to enure that the shelf does not wobble, as the keyhole hangers are in the same line and very hard to adjust. So relatively high precision is needed here, and probably a lot of fiddling.

**Design B** is made of two pieces of wood. Once piece will be mounted on the wall with sunken screws, inside a dovetail groove. The other piece of wood, will be joined in an unglued dovetail joint.  It is pretty cool, but I am unsure if i can pull it off. But given that I have access to a router (Bosch POF 1400 ACE), it might not be that bad. But I am missing a good dovetail bit, that is small enough for the shelf thickness.

**Design C** is similar to design A, but it is mounted using classic floating shelf mounts. Which is basically just two rods mounted to the wall. The shape of the mount needs to be chiseled into the shelf, and the rods might need to be shortened, if they are too long.

### The wood
For this project I choose walnut. I did not research a lot beforehand. But it sounded very cool to say "I'm building it in walnut". I found a place where they sold walnut wood in roughly the dimensions i needed. I thought that I would get some wood with a finish that was shelf ready. However the surfaces was pretty rough, due to tearout during during manufacturing.

In order to resolve this I decided to look for a Stanley finishing planer. I found one being sold by a sweet elderly lady 14km away from my home. After a 28 km bike ride in headwind, I now had a rusty Stanley no 4 planer. After fiddling with it and testing on some softer scrap wood, I gave it a try on the walnut. 

Quickly I discovered that walnut is harder, and required a bit more finesse and attention to grain direction. It became a bit easier once I realized the effect of slightly rotating the planer. This is how it went.

I think I still need to sand it quite a bit though. But the surface is somewhat nice, considering that I've never really planed before.




### Testing out router setup

I've never used a router. But one time spend a whole day riding a train and walking the country side, just to pick up a Bosch POF 1400 Ace at a good price. Finally the time has come to do some testing. I found a scrap piece of wood and tested out the beast. Here is how it went.

I cut the groove over a few passes, to not take away too much wood at a time. After having made the groove, I wanted to try a roundover bit. I had some difficulty adjusting it for the precise depth it needed to not make an edge. So after using the roundover bit, I gave the test-piece edge a little trim with the planer.
