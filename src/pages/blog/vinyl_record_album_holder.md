Not a lot of reflection here. Just a little story about building a shelf for holding vinyl records. In essence it is a piece of wood with a groove in it. It 'should be relatively simple' and 'I have all the tools already' are some of the clever things I've said before starting.

### Design

*The different designs in consideration*

I am considering two different designs. Design A is made by a single piece of wood, and will be mounted using keyhole hangers. Design B is made of two pieces of wood. Once piece will be mounted on the wall with sunken screws, inside a dovetail groove. The other piece of wood, will be joined in an unglued dovetail joint.

**Design A** is relatively simple. But it will be hard to enure that the shelf does not wobble, as the keyhole hangers are in the same line. So relatively high precision is needed here.

**Design B** is pretty cool, but I am unsure if i can pull it off. But given that I have access to a router (Bosch POF 1400 ACE), it might not be that bad.

### The wood
For this project I choose walnut. I did not research a lot beforehand. But it sounded very cool to say "I'm building it in walnut". I found a place where they sold walnut wood in roughly the dimensions i needed. I had this idea that I would get some pretty wood, that would be pretty to hang in our home. However the surfaces was pretty rough, due to tearout during during manufacturing. In order to resolve this I decided to look for a Stanley finishing planer. I found one being sold by a sweet elderly lady 14km away from my home. After a 28 km bike ride in headwind, I now had a rusty Stanley no 4 planer. After fiddling with it and testing on some softer scrap wood, I gave it a try on the walnut. I quickly discovered that walnut is harder, and required a bit more finesse and attention to grain direction. It became a bit easier once I realized the effect of slightly rotating the planer. This is how it went.

I think I still need to sand it quite a bit though. But the surface is somewhat nice, considering that I've never really planed before.
